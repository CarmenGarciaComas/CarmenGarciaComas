- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarmenGarciaComas
- 👀 I’m interested in community ecology, mainly plankton communities but not only.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit about mathematical modelling and project management. Both equally time consuming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project testing ecological theory, proof of concept through data analysis, modelling and/or experiments.
- 📫 How to reach me: carmencomas@gmail.com currently based at ICM in Barcelona.
